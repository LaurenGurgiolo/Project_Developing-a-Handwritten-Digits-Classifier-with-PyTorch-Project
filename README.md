# Project_Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch 

 Project for Udacity's course: Introduction to Deep Learning

At the end of the course, you'll build a handwritten digit 
classifier by:

Setting up a Jupyter notebook and importing the necessary libraries

Loading and preprocessing your image data

Designing and building your neural network in PyTorch

Choosing an optimizer and loss function

Training your model

Evaluating your model

Optimizing your hyperparameters or training process

This will ultimately allow you to train a model that recognizes handwritten digits!
